# Just a Wall Kinect P18

This project consists of connecting the Kinect to Processing, and as a demonstration, generate a game in which each person must be placed in front of the camera, and make different positions to win the game.

It does not only consist of that, but also at the end of the rounds, one can create his own position, and it will be added to the original program.

This was a project that lasted approximately 8 months, and was presented at the Teen Summit 2018, held by the Clubhouse Network.
